                    The Consortium of King&#39;s College London, Imperial College London, and University of Oxford
                    (KCL-ICL-OX
                    dHCP
                    Consortium) has collected data from human subjects (data subjects) under the Developing Human
                    Connectome
                    Project (dHCP data).
                    I understand that the KCL-ICL-OX dHCP Consortium will release Open Access dHCP Data, i.e.
                    dHCP data which has an extremely low potential for identification of data subjects (see #3 below)
                    after
                    an
                    individual researcher has agreed to these Open Access dHCP Data - Terms of Use
                    I request access to Open Access dHCP Data for NON-COMMERCIAL AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT research purposes
                    (research), and I agree to the following terms:
                <ol>
                    <li>I declare that I am employed by, or a student of, a non-commercial/not-for-profit organisation
                        and I will not
                        use dHCP data for any direct commercial purpose, such as fee-for-service work. I understand that
                        if I wish to
                        use dHCP data for any direct commercial purpose, my institution will be required to obtain a
                        commercial
                        licence from the KCL-ICL-OX dHCP Consortium, and the KCL-ICL-OX dHCP Consortium has no
                        obligation to
                        provide such a commercial license.
                    </li>
                    <li> I will use dHCP data responsibly and only for non-commercial research that enables the
                        advancement of
                        science and medicine.
                    </li>
                    <li> I understand that Open Access dHCP Data consists of MRI brain imaging data and non-sensitive
                        data (age at
                        birth, age at scan and gender) which have been obtained from data subjects. In order to protect
                        data
                        subjects, these data have been pseudonymised and subjected to post-collection processing (data
                        processing)
                        to remove any data elements that could (with suitable technology) otherwise be reconstructed
                        and/or
                        processed to reveal facial features of the data subjects. If I receive any dHCP data, in error,
                        that have not
                        been subjected to the data processing I will:
                    </li>
                    <li> I will promptly notify the KCL-ICL-OX dHCP Consortium if (a) dHCP data has been accidentally
                        lost or stolen or
                        (b) has been accessed by another person, and (c) of any change in my contact details.
                    </li>
                    <li>I understand that dHCP data are experimental and may contain errors (including errors and/or
                        omissions in
                        data processing), and I accept that they are provided on an &quot;as is&quot; basis and without
                        any
                        warranty (a) of
                        accuracy, completeness, or fitness for any purpose or (b) that their use will not infringe the
                        rights of any third
                        party. Any representations or warranties given by any representative relating to dHCP data,
                        either expressed
                        or implied, are excluded to the maximum extent permitted by law. Except to the extent prohibited
                        by law, the
                        KCL-ICL-OX dHCP Consortium accepts no liability for any kind of damages or loss arising in any
                        way from my
                        use of dHCP data or from making dHCP data available to me, however caused including without
                        limitation,
                        economic damages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I will comply with all applicable legislation and with all relevant rules and regulations
                        concerning data
                        protection, information governance and ethical research. If required, I will ensure I have
                        ethical approval in
                        place to use dHCP data for the research from the relevant committee or office that oversees
                        research on
                        human subjects e.g. Research Ethics Committee, Institutional Review Board or similar.

                    <li>
                        I understand that dHCP data are being made available to me on the understanding that they are
                        only for use
                        by me and co-workers at the same institution who have also signed this agreement in their own
                        right. I will
                        keep the dHCP data strictly confidential, and will not publish, share or redistribute dHCP data
                        and will refer
                        any requests (including requests from my supervisors, co-workers or those that I supervise) for
                        access to dHCP
                        data to the KCL-ICL-OX dHCP Consortium.
                    </li>
                    <li>I understand that dHCP data are, and will remain, the property of the KCL-ICL-OX dHCP Consortium
                        and I
                        agree that these Terms of Use do not grant me any ownership rights to the dHCP data nor shall
                        they affect the
                        rights of the KCL-ICL-OX dHCP Consortium to provide dHCP data to others.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I will protect dHCP data and prevent unauthorised use and access, by using suitable safeguards
                        (administrative and/or technical and/or physical).
                    </li>
                    <li>In any Publication reporting the results of the research, I will only include images compiled
                        from dHCP data
                        that conform to the specifications set out below:
                    </li>
                    <li>I will only share or redistribute data derived from dHCP data (derived data), such as
                        multiple-subject data
                        averages , when they do not contain or consist of dHCP data, and cannot be reverse-engineered to
                        generate
                        dHCP data, and there is no foreseeable risk of a data subject being identified from the derived
                        data. I will
                        contact the KCL-ICL-OX dHCP Consortium and discuss making any derived data available via the
                        KCL-ICL-OX
                        dHCP Consortium if the derived data do not meet the specifications for sharing or
                        redistribution, as set out in
                        this paragraph.

                    <li>I will adequately cite & acknowledge the constituent institutions of the KCL-ICL-OX dHCP
